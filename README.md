# Letter Frequency Calculator

A Java program that calculates the frequency of letters in any input text and compares it with standard frequencies in multiple languages. The program:
- Takes text input from the user
- Counts how often each letter appears (case-insensitive)
- Compares frequencies with standard frequencies in:
  - English
  - French
  - German
  - Italian
  - Dutch
- Identifies which language the text most closely matches

## Features
- Multi-language support
- Case-insensitive letter counting
- Detailed frequency analysis
- Language matching
- Comprehensive comparison tables

## How to Use
1. Compile the program: `javac LetterFrequency.java`
2. Run the program: `java LetterFrequency`
3. Enter your text when prompted (press Enter twice to finish)
4. View the analysis results:
   - Letter frequency table comparing with all supported languages
   - Language analysis showing the best matching language

## Output Format
The program provides two main analysis sections:
1. Letter Frequency Analysis - Shows how often each letter appears in your text compared to standard frequencies in each supported language
2. Language Analysis - Shows which language your text most closely matches based on letter frequency patterns
